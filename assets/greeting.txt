Congratulations on adding {bot_name} to your server! Students can now use the {chan_name} to join group chats for their departments and courses without any clutter!

Students can use PointyPal to join their course or department by messaging in the chat:

`@PointyPal join-class [COURSE CODE]`
`@PointyPal join-department [DEPARTMENT]`

Some example course codes might be `CHEM1051`, `CS2100`, or `MEEN3010`, but any class in this format will work!

**Server owners:** You can move this channel wherever fits best for you - just make sure not to rename the chat and that it remains visible to {bot_name}!
